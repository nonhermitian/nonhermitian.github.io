Kaleidoscope (|version|)
########################

Kaleidoscope is a visualization package for quantum computation that focuses on interactivity.
In addition, there is a range of functionality for the `Qiskit <https://qiskit.org/>`_ quantum computing
framework for visualizing quantum systems and their associated properties.

Kaleidoscope is released under the Apache 2 license.  Kaleidoscope is copyright IBM as I work there,
however it is not an official or unofficial IBM product.
